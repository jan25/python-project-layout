## flat layout

Top level package is `lib` and is inside `lib` folder in root of this project. The tests are placed along with modules inside `lib`.

This layout works best for upto few python modules under one package.

Copy this project and get started with:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements

pytest
python -m unittest
```
